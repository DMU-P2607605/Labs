                It was founded to preserve beauty of the seaside coastline including lakes system, peat bogs, meadows and woods.
                But the most important is to protect the most exceptional in Europe belt of moving dunes.
                As they move along the Mierzeja Lebska (Lebska Spit), they uncover ancient tree stumps and the fossilized
                remains of forest once growing there.  </div>

                  <div class="b">In a small corner of western Poland, near the town of Gryfino, a strange and eerie woodland exists. This bizarre collection of curved trees, named the “Crooked Forest,” is shrouded in mystery and despite the numerous different theories that have been proposed over the years, no one truly knows what caused the trees to adopt this conformation.
                    The Crooked Forest consists of around 400 pine trees that grow with a 90-degree bend at their base, the vast majority of which are bent northward. Curiously, the Crooked Forest is enveloped by a larger forest of straight growing pine trees. It is estimated that the trees were planted in the 1930s
                  and that they were around 7-10 years old when they experienced whatever force/damage that resulted in trunk curvature.</div>

The entire area covers 385km2, which is interspersed with dense woodland, dunes and marshland, criss-crossed with biking, hiking and horse-riding trails, with the forest itself being home to 81 endangered species. The past decades have witnessed successful attempts to reintroduce beaver, elk and lynxes back to the wild.</div>

                  The area surrounding the waterfall is covered with beautiful old mixed forest dotted with picturesque rocky outcrops. Since 1958 the waterfall and its immediate vicinity have been a protected area and form the Wilczka Waterfall Nature Reserve. </div>

Do you remember your geography lessons about stalactites, stalagmites, pillars and cave pearls? You will find all of them here live. The cave is rather small as its length is only 240 m. Still, the amount of cave forms is so amazing that you won’t like to leave the cave too soon. In the cave there is a stable temperature of 9° C, the humidity is as high as 95%. The cave has also small lakes. The number of people entering the cave every day is limited to protect the cave natural environment. </div>

                  The peaks that surround the lake rise about 1,000 meters above its surface; one of them is Rysy (2,499 meters), the highest peak in the Polish Tatras.
                Morskie Oko is one of the most popular destinations in the Tatras, often receiving over 50,000 visitors during the vacation season. It is reached by foot in about two hours from the nearest road that allows motorized access.
              The name "Morskie Oko" ("Eye of the Sea") is derived from an old legend, according to which the lake was connected to the sea via an underground passage.
