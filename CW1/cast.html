              <p>Before Iron Man hit, Robert Downey Jr. was an acclaimed film and television actor whose career had dropped off considerably after very public struggles with addiction. Director an producer both fought for Downey to get a shot at the character of Tony Stark,
                both because of his talent and because his personal demons could mirror those of Stark himself (who, in the comics, is an alcoholic).
                Robert Downey Jr. has evolved into one of the most respected actors in Hollywood. He made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film "Pound" at the age of five.
              You may see the fragment of the film right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0Uj4BkoJ9A">here.</a> With an amazing list of credits to his name,
                he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business. </p>

            <div class="about">
              <p>Iron Man was the first Marvel-produced movie under their alliance with Paramount, and Favreau served as the director and an executive producer.
                During early scenes in Iron Man, Favreau appears as Tony Stark's driver, Happy Hogan. He wrote two issues of a planned mini-series for Marvel Knights titled Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas, that debuted in September 2008 before being canceled in November 2008.
                 Favreau also directed and executive produced the film's sequel, Iron Man 2.
                 Favreau said in December 2010 that he would not direct Iron Man 3 but remain an executive producer.</p>

            <div class="about">
              <p>Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach.
                He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role.
              Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of "less is more" when editing the film. </p>
